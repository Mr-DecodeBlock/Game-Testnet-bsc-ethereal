Hello, we are the Guzmán brothers. We believe that games must be fun!. We are developing a dApp, a new decentralized game called Ethereal's Chronicles. We are using Binance Smart Chain as our Blockchain to engage and reward our users for playing with our tokens (Kopernik token). In Ethereal's world almost everything is a crypto-collectible.

Basically is a highly interactive multiplayer fighting style game. You can create new characters with awesome and unique characteristics burned and saved into BSC and use them to fight other's players characters. Every character is unique, special and very valuable!

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.2.

## How to clone and install source code?

Run `npm install` after clonning the project to download all the required libraries.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

## About Ethereal's Game
We create our own images for Ethereal's Game. All characters were made by the ukrainian artist Ihor Khoynyak, one of the most talented artists in the world!

Also the characters and the game were in turn based on the histories written by Miguel Guzmán. Coding made by Ricardo Guzmán. Thank God that finally we made this project happen.
